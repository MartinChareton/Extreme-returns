# Extreme-returns
This repository is comprised of codes, data and report of an empirical study on Heavy tails and Power Law in financial markets and real economies.
Data comes from CAC40 from which are computed daily returns of which the normality of the distribution is assessed.
The study assesses the likelihood of a powerlaw fit on the tails of CAC40 returns. Then, as it is assumed to generate heavy tails, we try to filter out volatility clustering around extreme returns through a GARCH modelization. We then assess if the filtration enhances the likelihood of a normal distribution on the residuals.
